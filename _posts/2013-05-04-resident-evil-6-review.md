{% include JB/setup %}
I already had problems setting up the game as it wouldnt work startup (fixed it by windows xp compatibility)
Then I started the game.....
I had to wait like 30minutes to play because of the fucking Prolouge.

Well first we have our protaginist in the prolouge Leon which is rescuing his Female Partner "idk the name"
for some reason they have to check a dead body AFTER THEY SAW ZOMBIES BREAK OUT. They didnt die sadly. Anyways i continued
and i forgot there are like 20qt events in the prolouge already. It teaches nothing useful like the slide or switching weapons.
It teaches how to make medicine.... are you fucking kidding me the only thing more useless is telling me how to shoot.... oh wait
they did that too, fucking great waste of money capcom.
There isnt much realism but hey its zombie games.
It also seems that they love rubbing Glazed Donuts all over their skin. Anyways I only could play the Prolouge before I quitted.
So i instead watched the endings and readed the storys. The story is the same rehashed shit from RE5, its capcom what do you expect.
There are like 30million or more Bugs. The A.I is terrible, my A.I Partner literally runned in circles while i was stuck in a corner.


anyways
final scores:
A.I 2/10
Bugfree 1/10
Fun 10/10 (because you can use those bugs)
Gameplay 4.5/10 (shoot zombies and die and a qte once in a while)
Story 0/10 (repeated story)

Final Score: 2/10
